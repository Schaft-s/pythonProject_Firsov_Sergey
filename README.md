### Hello, I am Sergey Firsov, a student at MIPT.  
### This is my first python project, a 3d Rubik's cube - "graphics app"

**Description:**  
 - This is a model of a Rubik's cube, which is made in 3D and can be easily rotated using the keyboard.  
 - All movement takes place due to the mouse and keyboard, in the game there are hints for this, there is also a detailed description below  
 - You can change the viewpoint and then change the center of rotation using the appropriate sensors  
 - You can change the direction of rotation of the side by pressing the middle mouse button  
 - You can randomly shuffle the cube by clicking on the sensor under it  
 - **_You must install Ursian to use this app (pip install ursina)_**
 - The possibility of recording several commands at once and playing them together **(new)**
 
**In development:**    
   - Adding standard formulas for speedcubing    
   - Timer    
    
**Instruction:**  
 - Moving the camera - holding down the right mouse button  
 - Similar to standard assembly formulas:  
 - To turn clockwise  ->  press on the keyboard   
   - Right  (R)  &emsp;    ->     d  
   - Left   (L)&emsp;&emsp;  ->     a  
   - Upp    (U) &ensp;&emsp;->     w  
   - Down   (D)  &ensp;  ->     s  
   - Front  (F)&ensp; &ensp;  ->     q  
   - Bottom (B)&nbsp; ->     s  
 - To turn counterclockwise - press the middle mouse button - _now all rotations will be counterclockwise_
 - To change the center of rotation using the appropriate sensors  (balls of the suitable color)   
 _for example: if you spin cubic and now look at the side in which center is red - push red sencor near you - now all rotations will be understandable -
 it's like you're looking at this side_  
 - To randomly shuffle the cube - click on the white sensor _(Random)_ under cube 
 - About command mode:
   - to enter in it  -> press 'r'
   - to go out -> f
   - to write  -> same (dawsqe)
   - to write "-"  -> g _(when you write '-' -> next rotate will be in another side (counterclockwise or clockwise)_
   - to delete  -> h
